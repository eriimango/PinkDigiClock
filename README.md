# PinkDigiClock
Digital Clock created with Tkinter

For one of my 100 Days of Code I created a digital clock GUI in python using Tkinter.
It litereally took less than 15 minutes to create

I created a 12 hour format and a 24 hour format (seperate codes)

I would like to further implement both formats into 1 where it will prompt the user which format would they like to display (including adding an analog format).
I would also like to add a logo and/or an image below the display.

Why pink? ....Well why not pink?
